# drperf: what it computes

**Measurement.** `perfmark_begin(ρ, x, v)` (`perfmark_begin_v`: all declared
states, with dynamically sized storage) … `perfmark_end(ρ)` around a code region yields a *trigger*
$t$: region $\rho(t)$, declared state vector $v(t) \in \mathbb{Z}^k$, thread
$\tau(t)$, sequence numbers $b(t) < e(t)$ from one atomic counter shared by
all threads. DynamoRIO attributes every executed
user-space instruction to the innermost open trigger of its thread, or the
leader thread's if it has none. $n_\beta(t)$ is the number of instructions of
basic block $\beta$ attributed to $t$ on all threads;
$\mathrm{cost}(t) = \sum_\beta n_\beta(t)$. Counts are exact and, for
deterministic single-threaded programs, reproducible to the instruction. Only
per-point means $c_\beta(v)$ over triggers with $v(t) = v$ are stored, for at
most 4,096 points per region by default (configurable with
`DRPERF_MAX_STATES_PER_REGION` or the client option `-max_states_per_region`)
and within a bounded counter allocation; calls
beyond either are counted and reported, not placed at a point.  Blocks beyond
the counter table are merged into one slot, which is reported and invalidates
the run. Counter arrays share a 96-GiB virtual-address budget. A separate
process-wide bound of 65,536 region keys, including overflow buckets, terminates
measurement with an explicit error if reached. The raw report records these
budgets and the allocated counter bytes.

**Optional measurement scope.** `DRPERF_FOLLOW_THREADS=0` attributes instructions
only while their own thread has an open region; unmarked workers do not inherit
the leader's region. `DRPERF_NATIVE_EXEC_MODULES=basenames` requests native
execution of whole modules (experimental DynamoRIO `-native_exec_list`);
this bypasses instrumentation and is not a validated GX measurement mode
(see README). `DRPERF_EXCLUDE_CUDA_MODULE=basename` suppresses the selected
module's blocks and synchronous callees beneath its exported CUDA driver/runtime
and cuBLAS/cuDNN/cuSOLVER/cuSPARSE/cuFFT/cuRAND/cuTENSOR APIs. Exclusion depth is
thread-local and nested; normal return restores counting. Asynchronous callee
work on another thread is outside this stack scope. Raw output records the
scope, matched exports, call count and excluded instructions. The latter is a
process-wide diagnostic, not a per-region cost. An exclusion matching no exports
invalidates the run. These options change what cost means; compare identical
scopes and check remaining module attribution. Non-GX programs retain the
measurement above. Counting exclusion alone still instruments execution.

Loading `gx_cuda.so` automatically enables its CUDA-module exclusion and
executes its `gxvm_gpu_native_run` entry and its dynamic callees natively, returning
to instrumented host code afterward. This additional device-work boundary can
also be used on emulator worker threads. Native work contributes no instruction
counts, including to the `excluded_instructions` diagnostic. Raw metadata
records installed boundaries and native calls. It is for functional GX, without
GXVM timing. GX loader/dispatch stubs remain instrumented.
`DRPERF_NATIVE_GX=0` (`-no_auto_gx`) disables automatic GX handling. Explicit
`DRPERF_NATIVE_GX=1` with a CUDA-module selection supports renamed emulators.
Do not combine GX work-boundary replacement with whole-module native execution.

**Cost formulae (`derive`).** Over the observed points $V \subset \mathbb{Z}^k$,
$|V| \ge k + 2$, each block gets a least-squares plane
$a_\beta \cdot v + d_\beta$; tolerance $\theta(y) = \max(64,\ 0.05\,y)$.
$\beta$ is *affine* if $|c_\beta(v) - a_\beta \cdot v - d_\beta| \le \theta(c_\beta(v))$
for all $v \in V$; a negative intercept is allowed because the origin need
not belong to the input domain (e.g. `cost = a*(depth-1)`). It *scales* in
variable $j$ if moreover $|a_{\beta j}|(\max V_j - \min V_j) > \theta(\max_v c_\beta)$
or the points are exactly coplanar with $a_{\beta j} \ne 0$ (other slopes
are folded into the constant); a block scaling in no variable is *constant*;
every other block is *irregular*.

$$\mathrm{cost}(v) \approx A \cdot v + D,\qquad A_j = \sum_{\text{scaling in } j} a_{\beta j},\quad D = \sum_{\text{affine}} d_\beta' + \sum_{\text{constant}} \operatorname{mean}_v c_\beta(v),$$

with $I(v) = \sum_{\text{irregular}} c_\beta(v)$ tabulated at $V$ only.
OpenMP runtime blocks are excluded as waiting. Before fitting, perfmark library
and native Python binding blocks are excluded by identity. If the run contains
the Python empty-region calibration, the remaining inside block profile is
subtracted once per region invocation, and the outside profile is subtracted
once per **direct** child invocation at that parent state. The outside profile
is the difference between the calibration outer region's exclusive vector and
the bare-loop exclusive vector, divided by the child count. It does not include
the child's inside profile. Run-specific calibration profiles are kept separate.
The corrected vectors are fitted, so varying marker counts affect slopes as well
as constants; non-affine marker counts are removed before irregularity testing.
Variables collinear over $V$ cannot be separated and
are reported. For $k = 1$ and an irregular share above 5%, $V$ may be split
once into two regimes of at least 3 points (3 is flagged weak), chosen by
the mean per-point irregular fraction. Guaranteed: exactly affine counts give exact $A, D$ (P1); at
$v \in V$ the error is at most $\sum_{\text{affine}} \theta$ (P2); irregular
cost never enters $A$ or $D$ (P3). Not provided: loop detection or
data flow (the only link to $v$ is co-variation across $V$: an undeclared
variable shows as irregular if independent, hides in $D$ if balanced across
$V$, is charged to $v$ if correlated), non-affine
forms (curves such as $n \log n$ can pass as a plane over a limited range;
the sign of $D$ does not establish curvature), regimes in more than one variable, checked extrapolation beyond
$V$, min–max intervals.

**Relationships (`learn`).** For a trigger $t$ of region $A$ with state $x$,
over every region $R$ and state $u$:
$\mathrm{count}_R(t) = |\{t' : \rho(t') = R,\ b(t') < b(t)\}|$,
$\mathrm{cum}_{R,u}(t) = \sum u(t')$ over that set, $\mathrm{last}_{R,u}(t)$ =
$u$ of its latest member, $\mathrm{cumend}_{R,u}(t) = \sum u(t')$ over
$\{\rho(t') = R,\ e(t') < b(t)\}$. `learn` reports every
$x(t) = \sum_{j \in S} \gamma_j \varphi_j(t) + \delta$ with $|S| \le 3$,
$\gamma_j \in \{\pm 1, \pm 2\}$, holding exactly at every trigger of $A$
(in integer arithmetic, so "exact" means exact);
otherwise a least-squares fit, labelled approximate. Guaranteed: an exact
relation describes the run, not an estimate (R1). Not provided: relations
through undeclared variables, causality, happens-before (the order is the
counter's), protection against coincidence when candidates outnumber
triggers, so a relation counts only if exact in every run.

**Composition.** The basic-block fit remains a region's *own* cost: instructions
counted while it was the innermost open region. A separate symbolic composition
uses direct-child calls in the same thread, process, and run. Function boundaries
do not matter. Child interfaces are frozen; their blocks are never refitted
against parent PCVs. For each parent invocation, the trace supplies the child
call count and child arguments. The checker finds an affine call-count relation
and affine argument substitutions in the parent PCVs, checking every invocation
in exact rational arithmetic (including parents with zero child calls). When
both hold, the parent includes `(a*PCVs + d)*F_child(arguments)`. F denotes the
child's full interface, including its unexplained component and its descendants.

When arguments vary inside a parent, the checker additionally tries affine
substitutions in parent PCVs and the zero-based child invocation index `j`.
It retains `sum[j=0..count-1] F_child(arguments_j)` rather than averaging child
arguments. Unexplained multiplicities remain `calls(child)`; unexplained
argument relationships remain `pcvs_j`. These are trace-dependent sums, not
closed expressions in parent entry PCVs. Observed per-parent-state child
argument histograms are retained in the JSON report. A nonlinear count can be
made affine by an appropriate declared parent PCV, for example `selected_count`.
Recursion is reported as a recurrence, not solved or unrolled indefinitely.

The final unexplained report has the same structure: `U_parent = U_own_parent +
sum U_child`. Thus an irregular child does not prevent a compact parent
interface, and a parent cannot erase unexplained child work. A product `N*F`
denotes N applications of that interface, not N times the child's global
measured mean. The client aggregates block counts by region/state across callers;
it does not record block counts per invocation or per caller. Raw traces do
record thread-local per-invocation self/inclusive totals, whose scope differs
from the runtime-filtered, potentially all-thread block fits. Consequently this
composition does not claim exact inclusive instruction totals for individual
parents. Own-fit tolerance, repeated-state averaging, and unexplained-cost
limitations persist. Numerical inclusive predictions require additional assumptions
or finer block counters. No cross-thread parentage, parallel latency, or unobserved
input guarantee is inferred.

Composition uses the already marker-adjusted own fits, without adding marker
costs back. Raw counts and separately fitted `recordedRegimes` remain available
for audit and the recorded-count view. Marker-module exclusion is exact;
wrapper-profile subtraction is an estimate, not an exact counterfactual program
without annotations. Signed baseline differences are retained, and a requested
positive subtraction is capped at that block's available count. Unmatched
estimates are reported per state, not silently turned into negative counts.
Without a usable calibration/complete nesting trace, only identifiable marker
blocks are excluded. Caller-side PCV evaluation, argument preparation, and
wrapper paths not represented by calibration can remain. The guarantees on
exact collected counts apply to the raw measurements; calibrated costs inherit
the stated estimation limits.
Missing/crossing traces, omitted state buckets, and invalid measurements disable
composition. The exporter also disables it when the trace exceeds its configured
limit. Nonconstant affine call relations require more distinct parent/index
points than their design-matrix rank; dependent PCVs are disclosed. Constant
relations, including single-input cases, describe observations only.

`composition.check` checks a frozen composition against a separate execution's
trace and per-state counter coverage. It checks each available multiplicity and
argument relation in exact arithmetic without refitting, preserves unresolved
sum fallbacks, reports new call-graph edges, distinguishes absent parents from
zero child calls, and rejects incompatible PCV schemas. PCV name order and JSON
object-key order do not change argument meaning. This validates structural
relations at the newly observed calls, not predictions of their instruction
cost or unknown U values. A context-dependent shared child can have an affine
global state mean and yet fail badly as a numerical cost prediction for one
caller; the composition examples include this negative control and its PCV
refinement.
