# drperf

Cheap perf interface generation for coding changes.

Exact instruction counts for marked regions of a program, turned into a cost
function of the state you declare, plus the relations between those states
across regions, from one run.

DynamoRIO-based, so the counts cover everything the region executes:
interpreter, allocator, C/Rust/C++ extensions, worker threads.

## Use

```
./build.sh                 # DynamoRIO 11.3.0, marker library, client, examples
bin/drperf ./myapp         # or: bin/drperf python app.py
```

```
cost per call, in instructions

  handle = 1,336.7*q + 363.4   (inflight: no effect; 12% of the cost follows no declared state)
      q: 504.7 parse [base], 287 __printf_buffer [libc.so.6], 95 __printf_buffer_write [libc.so.6]
      constant: 170.8 parse [base], 81.5 __memcpy_avx_unaligned_erms [libc.so.6]
      unexplained: 2,053.1 parse [base]
  ingest = 152*batch + 16   (bytes: moved in step with batch)
      batch: 152 ingest [base]
      constant: 11 ingest [base], 2 _init [base], 2 perfmark_end [libperfmark.so]
  parse  = 5*len + 487   (entries: did not vary)
      len: 5 parse [base]
      constant: 482 parse [base]

relations

  handle.inflight = cum(ingest.batch) - cum(handle.q)   (holds at all 57 calls)
```

Each term is broken down into the functions it comes from, largest first, so a
coefficient that moves points at the code that moved it.

That is the whole interface: `drperf` followed by the command you would have
run anyway. No options.

Start with `examples/playground`, a 250-line C system with three regions and a
one-line change to measure. `SPEC.md` states exactly what is computed, on one
page.

## Markers

You declare a region and the integers that matter to it. Nothing else is added
to the program. Up to four declared states per region; all of them form the key
and the formula is derived in all of them.

```c
#include "perfmark.h"
perfmark_begin("parse", "len", n);
...
perfmark_end("parse");

const char *names[2] = { "q", "inflight" };
int64_t vals[2] = { q, inflight };
perfmark_begin_v("handle", 2, names, vals);
```

```python
import perfmark
with perfmark.region("schedule", running=len(self.running), waiting=len(self.waiting)):
    ...
```

```rust
let _r = perfmark::Region::new_v("handle", &[("q", q), ("inflight", inflight)]);
```

Outside DynamoRIO the markers are empty functions, one call each.

## Reading the output

- A state gets a coefficient only if it varied during the run. Otherwise the
  line says why it has none: it never varied, it moved in step with another
  state, or the cost did not follow it.
- Cost that follows no declared state is reported as a percentage and left out
  of the formula, never smeared into a coefficient. It is broken down by
  function too, under `unexplained`.
- `cum(R.s)`, `last(R.s)`, `count(R)` and `cumend(R.s)` are counters over the
  triggers that began (or ended) before the one being explained. A relation is
  reported only if it holds exactly at every trigger.

## Late attach

DynamoRIO starts at the first marked region, not at process start, so imports,
model loading and warm-up run natively and are never translated. A small
preloaded library (`build/libdrperf_attach.so`) reserves DynamoRIO's address
space, and the marker library starts it at the first region. Threads that
already exist are taken over.

For vLLM this is the difference between 280 seconds and 26 (12 native), because
almost all of that run is PyTorch and vLLM startup that no region covers.

## Measured

| check | result |
|---|---|
| C loop, 3 repeats (`tests/ctest.c`) | 4 instrs/iteration exactly, identical |
| 4 workers under the main thread's region (`tests/cthreads.c`) | 4 x 400,006 attributed to `loop_work`, exact |
| marker path, 32 threads x 200K begin/end pairs | 4.2 µs per pair per thread |
| C / Rust / C++ suites (`examples/{c,rust,cpp}_suite`, 27 cases) | exact `a*n + d` with 0 irregular on every exactly-affine case (loops, nested regions, rep-string, pthreads, scoped threads, OpenMP with waiting excluded, virtual and template calls); a delta of +3 instructions per iteration recovered exactly; prediction 8x beyond the profiled range within 0.0%; byte-identical block dumps across repeats |
| negative controls | `n^2`, hash-table rehashing and an independent undeclared variable are reported as irregular, not fitted; `n log n` over a fourfold range passes as a line with a negative constant, which is flagged |
| two declared states, C (`c9_twovar`) | `4*n + 5*m + 29` exact, coefficients attributed to the two loops; the product `n*m` comes out 98.9% irregular |
| two declared states, Python (`examples/py_twovar`) | `1,028*n + 1,280*m`, 1.8% irregular, although both loops run in the same interpreter blocks |
| queue invariant, 2 threads | `q = cum(produce.m) - cum(consume.q)` learned exactly, in C, Rust and Python |
| vLLM `execute_model` (decode regime, all threads) | `172,749,376*num_tokens + 12,515,892`, 1.2% irregular; predicts a larger run's decode steps within 1.4% |
| vLLM slowdown | 25.7 s profiled vs 12.1 s native (2.1x); 41 s including analysis |

## How counting works

Every basic block gets two inline adds: the thread's total and the current
region's per-block counter, a pointer swapped by the markers. Regions are keyed
by (region, declared states, root region) and aggregated per thread, merged at
exit. Threads with no open region of their own count into the innermost region
of the leader, each with a private counter array, so counts stay exact under
concurrency. The marker path takes no lock. `rep movs/stos` are expanded so
each iteration counts one instruction. A region keeps at most 128 distinct
state combinations, which bounds memory when a declared state has many values.

## Caveats

- Instructions are not time. A change that removes instructions but adds cache
  misses passes; one that vectorizes and adds instructions looks worse.
- Counts are exact and reproducible for deterministic single-threaded programs.
  With OpenMP the partition of work varies between runs; the total usually does
  not, and runtime spin-waiting is excluded and reported separately.
- A marker pair costs a few hundred instructions. A region of a few lines is
  fine; a region inside a hot inner loop measures itself.
- A formula needs at least (variables + 2) different state points in the run.
- The numbers describe these binaries on this CPU. A toolchain or machine
  change invalidates a baseline.
- Kernel time is not counted; syscalls per region are reported as the hint.
- DynamoRIO 11.3.0 crashes in `dr_get_proc_address` on some torch libraries, so
  markers are looked up only in modules named `*perfmark*` and the main
  executable; module names come from file names because SONAME parsing is wrong
  for those libraries.
